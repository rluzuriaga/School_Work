# School_Work

This repository contains most of the work I have done for my programming classes in college/university. I will keep adding to this repository while taking more courses that I have to do programming in.

Each class used to have their own repository but I moved each one over to this one with their commit history and contributors.

Each class is in its own branch and master will only have this README file.

Bellow are the commit statements, from latest to oldest, for each branch (I am still adding them slowly)


## [CISD 40 - Database Design](#CISD40)
<!--## [CISD 31/31L - Database Management: Oracle](#CISD31)-->
